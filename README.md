**Community Era** empowers citizens to report, prioritize, and track local infrastructure issues, bridging the gap between communities and authorities. The project takes a messy, frustrating real-world problem—infrastructure neglect—and turns it into a streamlined, visual, and collaborative process.

At its core, the platform answers three simple questions for the user:
1. **Where is the problem?** (The Map)
2. **What is the proof?** (The Photo)
3. **What is being done?** (The Status Tracker)

## 🌟 The Problem We're Solving

Communities are faced with serious infrastructural problems:

- **60% of urban roads** have potholes/crack problems impacting the daily commute.
- **40% of households** have monthly water pipeline leakage.
- **70% of the populace** are not aware of the current restoration works.
- **Average Time Taken to Resolve Complaint:** 15-30 Days.
- Only **20% of complaints** are correctly prioritized by authorities.
- Less than **30% of the population** actually report infrastructure problems—more than **70%** of grievances are not recorded, causing delays in maintenance and resource allocation.

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- ❌ **Duplicate Reports**: The same issues are reported repeatedly, leading to inefficient use of authority resources.
- ❌ **Citizen Engagement**: Users do not engage actively in determining which issues they can contribute to.
- ❌ **Poor Transparency**: It’s difficult to monitor the progress of reported grievances.
- ❌ **Low Motivation**: Many citizens fail to report issues because they don't see immediate impact.
- ❌ **Evidence Gaps**: Issues reported via words alone may remain unanswered or disputed.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Community Era** is a complete ecosystem that empowers citizens, works on web and mobile devices, and provides real-time visibility and analytics to authorities. It is creative because it **shifts the narrative from "complaining to the government" to "mapping the community's needs."**

### 🎯 Core Features

#### 1. Neighborhood Infrastructure Problem Report
- **Function:** Enables citizens to report local problems accurately and easily.
- **Impact:** - Prevents duplicate reports using a 50-100m radius check.
  - Photos/videos serve as concrete proof, making tracing and verification easier.
  - Geolocation reporting ensures data applies to the physical world.

#### 2. Community Priority Ranking (Social Validation)
- **Function:** Facilitates the selection of topics that require prioritization.
- **Why it works:** It uses **Social Validation**. Because reports are public and pinned on a map, neighbors can upvote or comment on an existing issue. This "Community Validation" highlights urgency through collective data rather than just the volume of individual tickets.
- **Impact:** Reduces biases and assists authorities in directing attention where it is most required.

#### 3. Participation & Admin Dashboard
- **Function:** Identifies levels of active engagement and provides an Admin Dashboard built with **Recharts**.
- **Transparency:** The dashboard and public map make data transparent. Citizens can see the distribution of **"Resolved" vs. "Open"** cases across the entire city in real-time, which builds trust through accountability.
- **Impact:** Motivates users via contributor displays and tracks trends for areas needing interaction.

#### 4. Public Accountability Timeline
- **Function:** Enables public tracking of progress for infrastructure projects.
- **Impact:**
  - Status updates (on time, delayed) hold the government accountable.
  - Builds a two-way feedback channel via comments and up-votes.
  - Fosters trust through a real-time status tracker.
