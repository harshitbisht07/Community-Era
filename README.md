Community Era empowers citizens to report, prioritize, and track local infrastructure issues, bridging the gap between communities and authorities.

## 🌟 The Problem We're Solving

Communities are faced with serious infrastructural problems:

- **60% of urban roads** have potholes/crack problems impacting the daily commute
- **40% of households** have monthly water pipeline leakage
- **70% of the populace** are not aware of the current restoration works.
Average Time Taken to Resolve Complaint: **15-30 Days**
- Only **20% of complaints** are correctly prioritized by authorities
- Less than **30% of the population** actually report infrastructure problems - More than **70%** of grievances are not recorded, causing delays in maintenance and resource allocation 

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- ❌ **Duplicate Reports**: The same issues are reported repeatedly, thus inefficient use of authority resources.
- ❌ **Citizen Engagement** – Users do not engage actively in determining under which issues they can contribute.
- ❌ **Poor Transparency** – It’s difficult to monitor the progress of reported grievances.
- ❌ **Low Rates of Community Engagement** - Many citizens fail to report community issues because they lack motivation.
- ❌ **Evidence Gaps** – Issues reported via words alone may remain unanswered or disputed.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Community Era** is a complete ecosystem that empowers citizens, works on web and mobile devices, and provides real-time visibility and analytics to authorities.

### 🎯 Core Features

#### 1. Neighborhood Infrastructure Problem Report
- **Function:** Enables citizens to report local problems accurately and easily
- **Why Included:** Citizens first recognize concerns; Geolocation reporting means data applies to the physical world
– **Impact:**
  - Prevents duplicate reports using 50-100m radius check
  - Categorized and intensity reports enable efficient prioritization by the authorities.
  - Photos/videos serve as a concrete proof, which makes tracing problems easier.

#### 2. Community Priority Ranking (Voting)
- **Function:** Facilitates the selection of topics that require prioritization by the community.
- **Why Included:** Ensures that high-impact issues come to the forefront
- **Impact:**
  - Assists in directing the attention of the authorities where it is most required.
  - Vote transparency encourages trust among citizens
  – It reduces biases that may come solely from complaint data.

#### 3. Participation Awareness Dashboard
-**Function**: Identifies levels of active engagement and participation in each region.
- **Why Included:** Civic engagement falls if they fail to see their influence
- **Impact:**
  - By motivating users through active contributor displays
  - Keeps track of trends over time for areas that need more community interaction
  - Promotes participation in long-term monitoring

#### 4. Public Accountability Timeline
- **Function:** Enables public tracking of progress for infrastructure projects
- **Why Included:** Residents require insight into project Timelines and completion Status
- **Impact:**
  - Status updates (on time, delayed) hold the government accountable
  - Enables citizens to post comments and up-vote projects. This builds a two-way feedback channel.
  - the map/list view facilitates tracking of projects particular to an area.
  - Fosters trust and transparency in local governance.
